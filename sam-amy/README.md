# 04-Templating

**Author**: Amy Cohen & Sam Porter Giffords
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application renders blog posts on a page, while allowing the ability to filter by both author and category.  It also shows a section of each article and gives the reader the ability to expand each article. 

## Getting Started
A user must fork and clone the code, then open it on their own machine.  They also need to get jQuery (either by download or by using a CDN), pull icons from IcoMoon, and use Handlebars by going to the appropriate Handlebars site. 


## Architecture
This app uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript and jQuery for functionality, outside vendors for icons and pictures, and Handlebars for HTML templating use.  


## Change Log
Unused at this time.
